* It should be able to access exercises and randomly assemble them into an exam
* Each exercise has a correction specific to it, and as we generate the exam, the correction file is generated as well
* Each exercise is of a specific type, and exams are composed of different types of exercises
* Each exercise has a specific level of difficulty, and exams are composed of exercises of different levels of difficulty
* Each exercise is fit for a specific class, and an exam is composed of exercises for one specific class
